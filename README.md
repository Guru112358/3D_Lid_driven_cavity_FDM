A basic C++ solver to compute the 3D lid driven cavity problem using the SIMPLE algorithm, the solver is benchmarked using the Z=0.5 plane cut and compared with results from an openfoam simulation for Re=100.
The Eigen unsupported Tensor module is used for the arrays used in this work.the headers can be included by unzipping the given file.The program is run by the command " ./run  filename.inp (setup.inp) by default included in the repo).
